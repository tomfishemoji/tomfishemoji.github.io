        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Tom. I do computers and stuff.</p>

        <p><br>I dabble around programming and making websites occasionally, but I'm not very good at either. </p>
        <p>If you're curious, I'm <i>decent</i> at things like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but not much else. I generally use Apache on Ubuntu to host because I'm exceptionally lazy and unwilling to learn anything better.</p>
        <p><br>Moving away from nerdy things, I like automobiles, mostly trains. No idea why, maybe because I share my name with a fictional steam engine. Or maybe trains are just really cool. Probably that one.</p>

        <p><br>I do enjoy taking photos of things, but nothing professional-grade; I just use my phone. You can see my photos over at <a href="https://unsplash.com/mrDnomaid">Unsplash</a> (they're licensed under CC0, so do whatever you want with them, literally). Lesser quality photos go to my <a href="https://twitter.com/mrDnomaid/media">Twitter</a>. I'm not a fan of Instagram.</p>


        <h2 style="margin-top: 1em">Things about this site</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>It's designed to be as clean as possible. Hence the very basic colour scheme.</li>
        <li>I like animations, that's why things do other things when you put your cursor on them.</li>
        <li>It's hosted on GitHub pages and proxied with CloudFlare, so it's needlessly fast (Under 500ms in most cases).</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 1em">Anyway, that's pretty much it. If there's anything you think I should add here, feel free to Tweet at me.</p>
