I made my first Twitter account in August of 2013 with the handle “tomcar670fast”, which was also my email address. Due to my stupidity, I created a lot of weird Tweets. Let’s look at some of them.

---

Where better to start than my first ever Tweet?

{% include image.html path="tweet1.png" %}

No, I don’t know what I’m waiting for, nor why I decided to make this my first Tweet.

My second Tweet isn't much better.

{% include image.html path="tweet2.png" %}

It’s a recreation of a Top Gear scene made with LEGO. I don’t know why I wanted you to watch it so much.

After a spam of YouTube-related Tweets, we find this.

{% include image.html path="tweet3.png" %}

I really wanted people to look at some iPad accessories.

Immediately after getting a new phone, I begin spamming my minuscule amount of followers with Britian’s Got Talent.

It was at this moment I realised I wasn't going to be the next PewDiePie.

This one doesn't need explaining.

{% include image.html path="tweet8.png" %}

oh

{% include image.html path="tweet9.png" %}

{% include image.html path="tweet10.png" %}

Yes.

{% include image.html path="tweet11.png" %}

{% include quote.html quote="LOL rage is fun :)" author="Me, February 1st, 2015" %}

{% include image.html path="tweet12.png" %}


My YouTube channel was pretty bad.

If you didn't see it at the top of this page, this is what my account looked like back in 2015.
{% include image.html path="tomcar670fast-profile.png" %}

I mean it’s not the worst I’ve seen, but it’s still terrible.

😬😡😠😱

{% include image.html path="tweet13.png" %}

{% include image.html path="tweet14.png" %}


I’ve got nothing to say about this Tweet


---

{% include image.html path="tweet15.png" %}

Yes.

This is the end of the amusing Tweets on my old account. Hopefully you enjoyed laughing at them as much as I did finding them.

I might do another one of these for old Tweets from my current account, but most of the fun ones also contain personal information, so I probably won’t.
