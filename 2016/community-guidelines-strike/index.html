At the time he was “FletchTech90” and was rather cringy, so I took advantage of this and found a song on EpidemicSound and replaced some of its lyrics with one of his Vines.</p><figure class="image "> <img src="/img/posts/2016-community-guidelines-strike/timeline.png" alt="Sony Vegas timeline for the video." class="has-caption" /><figcaption class="image-caption">Sony Vegas timeline for the video.</figcaption></figure><p>I uploaded the video to YouTube, and about 10 people viewed it within the short time it was up, which is more than usual for one of my terrible videos. However when I came back to the website a few minutes after uploading, I was greeted with the message you see at the top of this post. I had gotten a Community Guidelines strike for an amusing satirical song.</p><p>So now you may be wondering, “what guideline did you break?”, and my answer to that is, I don’t know either.</p><hr /><figure class="image "> <img src="/img/posts/2016-community-guidelines-strike/guidelines.png" alt="The YouTube community guidelines." class="has-caption" /><figcaption class="image-caption">The YouTube community guidelines.</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s take a look at each guideline and see if my video broke it, shall we?</p><p><strong>Nudity</strong>: None at all, the video was just some text and a Plane9 visualiser.</p><p><strong>Harmful/Dangerous:</strong> Again, nothing in the song itself or the video is harmful or shows anyone in danger.</p><p><strong>Violent/Graphic:</strong> For the third time, the video is just a visualiser and some text.</p><p><strong>Copyright:</strong> My MCN, BroadbandTV, allows access to EpidemicSound, which is where I sourced the song from, and Fletch gave me permission to use the sound clips. (I technically didn’t even need his permission, as I used it in a heavily transformative way which does comply with Fair Use/Fair Dealing.) And even then, it would be a copyright strike, not a Community Guidelines strike.</p><p><strong>Hateful:</strong> For the 4th time, there is no actual “video” in the video, just text and a visualiser. Not even the song has any “hateful” lyrics.</p><p><strong>Threats:</strong> No lyrics in the song were threatening to anyone, nor was the video’s metadata.</p><p><strong>Spam:</strong> This is what I think might have happened. Since the Vine I took the “DAN” soundclips from was talking about DanTDM and the “album art” per se contains DanTDM, I added DanTDM and DiamondMinecart as tags. If this is the cause of this whole ordeal, this really should just be a little warning rather than a strike, but I don’t run YouTube, so I can’t change that.</p><p>Another theory my friend came up with is that one of YouTube’s robots scanned the video and misheard “Dan” as “damn” and as we know, YouTube now dislikes “profanity”. But if this was the case, the video would just be de-monetized, not be given a guidelines strike. I also doubt they have something set up to do this.</p><hr /><p>A bit later (after I had gotten a little less mad about the strike) I found a video that was claiming to be the “Minecraft PE 2016 official trailer” when it clearly wasn’t.</p><p>Obviously, I decided to report it. In the process of flagging the video, I noticed something strange.</p><p>You get 500 characters to report a video, but only 200 to appeal a strike that your entire channel could rest on.</p><p>Understandably, I took to Twitter again, spewing my followers with caps lock and profanity.</p><hr /><figure class="image "> <img src="/img/posts/2016-community-guidelines-strike/email.png" alt="The email YouTube send me after I got the strike" class="has-caption" /><figcaption class="image-caption">The email YouTube send me after I got the strike</figcaption></figure><p>I’d also like to talk about the email I received.</p><p>The second paragraph implies that my content is “unwanted” and “repetitive”, which it is most certainly not.</p><p>It also says that tags should (rather obviously) go into the tags box, not the description. But I’ve no joke found many a few videos that have the following in their description:</p><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>— — TAGS DON’T READ — —

Luckily though, the strike expires in 3 months, rather than 6 months, and the only feature I’ve lost is livestreaming, which I don’t do much, if at all.</p><p>If you want to watch the video, <a href="https://vid.me/KAgG">I’ve put it onto Vidme</a>, as I know they are fine with stuff like this (hell, they have a <a href="https://vid.me/Xi1p">kid being hit by a train</a> on their platform and they don’t care).</p><hr /><h3 id="update">Update:</h3><p>I received an email from YouTube right before I was about to publish this post, which told me that my video does infact not break their guidelines, and it has been reinstated. Also my strike is gone.</p><p>It would be awesome if they told me what rule I apparently broke in the first place, but that’s too much effort for YouTube I guess.</p><p>If you’d like to watch it on YouTube rather than vidme, you can click <a href="https://youtu.be/TAeJIJkPvQM">here</a>.</p><figure class="image "> <img src="/img/posts/2016-community-guidelines-strike/email2.png" alt="The second email I got from YouTube, telling me that my video does not actually violate any guideline." class="has-caption" /><figcaption class="image-caption">The second email I got from YouTube, telling me that my video does not actually violate any guideline.</figcaption></figure><hr><aside style="font-style: italic;"><p>Got a comment or a query?
